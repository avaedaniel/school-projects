Repository for showcasing computer science projects completed with group effort at The Ohio State University.

This repository contains group projects I worked on during my time at OSU as part of the cse3901-2025sp-1130-36121 organization. Each project was a collaborative effort with 3 other students (Yoyi Liao, Jia Hui, Ryan Carmody), with the exception of brutus-buckeye4 and brutus-buckeye6. Below is a list of projects and my contributions:
