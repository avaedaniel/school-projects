Repository for showcasing computer science projects completed with group effort at The Ohio State University.

This repository contains group projects I worked on during my time at OSU as part of the cse3901-2025sp-1130-36121 organization. Each project was a collaborative effort with 3 other students (Yoyi Liao, Jia Hui, Ryan Carmody). Below is a list of projects and my contributions:

- **project2-group5**: [Describe your contributions]
- **project6-group5**: Implemented arithmetic expression evaluation with operator precedence and parentheses support in script2.js.
